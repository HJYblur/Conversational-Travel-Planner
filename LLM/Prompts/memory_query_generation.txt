Dialog history:
TA: I see! I know from experience that you enjoy relaxing vacations on a beach. Does a trip to Nice in France sound interesting?
User:   In some sense it does, however, it is winter now, and therefore not too warm (even in France). So maybe somewhere further away?

Example input:
TA: Hi, I am Alice. Today, I am here to help you plan your next great travel adventure. What is your name?
User: My name is Sofia.
Desired response: 
"Alice is here to plan Sofia's next great trip."

Example input:
CA: As I remember from our previous conversation you love to travel! Would you like something similar to your road trip to the USA, or a more relaxed vacation close to nature?
User: Hmm. Maybe not a road trip. To be honest, I would like to go somewhere warm. A place where I can truly relax and recover.
Desired response: 
"Sofia would like to go somewhere warm where she can relax and recover."
